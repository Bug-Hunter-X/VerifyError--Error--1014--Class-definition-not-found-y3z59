This repository demonstrates a VerifyError in ActionScript 3 that occurs when accessing a property of an object created within an event handler. The error arises when the object's class definition is located in a separate SWF file. This issue is often related to class loading and linkage issues between SWF files in an ActionScript project. The solution involves ensuring the correct linkage and export settings for the class definition in the external SWF file.  Properly configuring the ActionScript Compiler (ASC) options and ensuring the target SWF can correctly access and load the required class definition are crucial steps to resolve this issue.
